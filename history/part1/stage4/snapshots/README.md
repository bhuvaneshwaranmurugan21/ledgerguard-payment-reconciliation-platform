# LedgerGuard

**A three-way payment reconciliation platform that proves processor activity, balanced internal
ledger movement, and bank settlement agree at the correct business grain.**

A completed payment pipeline does not prove that money reconciles. LedgerGuard keeps processor,
ledger, and bank evidence independent, reconstructs their financial meaning, and emits a versioned
proof or an exact unexplained difference. It never treats equal row counts as settlement proof.

## Correctness boundary

LedgerGuard reconciles at two grains:

- **Transaction:** processor captures, refunds, chargebacks, and reversals against the relevant
  balanced ledger movements.
- **Settlement:** processor payout reports and deductions against clearing-account movements and
  actual bank deposits.

All money uses integer minor units plus an explicit currency. Identical redelivery is idempotent;
identity reuse with different content is rejected. Late data creates a new proof revision instead
of rewriting historical evidence.

## Current status

Part 1 is `PART1_FOUNDATION_COMPLETE`. Stage 0 establishes the corrective baseline, Stage 1
freezes financial semantics, Stage 2 encodes the versioned active contract set, Stage 3 validates
canonical bytes and contract coherence, and Stage 4 freezes final completion governance. The
overall project remains `PROJECT_IN_PROGRESS`.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Stage 0 baseline governance | `LOCAL_VERIFIED` after CI |
| Financial semantic decisions | `DESIGNED/MODELED` and frozen |
| Semantic acceptance examples | `LOCAL_VERIFIED` after CI |
| Corrected active `v2` contracts | `LOCAL_VERIFIED` after CI |
| Canonical contract coherence | `LOCAL_VERIFIED` after CI |
| Part 1 completion governance | `LOCAL_VERIFIED` after CI |
| Historical `v1` contracts | `SUPERSEDED_BEFORE_RUNTIME_USE` and byte-preserved |
| Reconciliation implementation | `UNCLAIMED` |
| Managed AWS reconciliation | `UNCLAIMED` |
| Performance and cost | `UNCLAIMED` |
| Production custody or compliance | `UNCLAIMED` |

See the [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [correctness model](docs/correctness.md),
[failure model](docs/failure-model.md), [scorecard](docs/scorecard.md), and
[project completion contract](contracts/project-completion-v1.json). The active contract authority
is the [version registry](contracts/active-contract-set-v1.json), supported by the
[contract model](docs/contract-model.md), [Stage 2 requirements](docs/part1-stage2-requirements.md),
and [Stage 2 gap audit](docs/stage2-gap-audit.md). Canonical byte and linked-artifact authority is
defined by the [coherence model](docs/contract-coherence.md) and
[Stage 3 gap audit](docs/stage3-gap-audit.md). Final Part 1 authority is defined by the
[completion document](docs/part1-completion.md), [Stage 4 gap audit](docs/stage4-gap-audit.md), and
[Part 2 handoff](contracts/part1-part2-handoff-v1.json). Historical stage authorities and every
v1/v2 schema remain immutable.

## Foundation validation

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
ledgerguard-foundation
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
mypy src
pytest
```

## Scope

The planned managed validation uses synthetic data in one AWS region. It will not establish
financial custody, PCI certification, multi-region recovery, or sustained production operation.
